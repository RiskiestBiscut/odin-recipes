    <h6>Wild Rice Soup</h6>
    <p>The next time you have a day when all you want to do is pull on your biggest sweater and curl up on the couch, make this creamy wild rice soup. If you ask me, it’s the best kind of comfort food. It’s creamy and cozy, but it’s nourishing too. Colorful autumn veggies like carrots, celery, and mushrooms fleck its surface, and nutty wild rice and white beans make it nice and hearty. And as for that creamy broth? Well, there’s actually no heavy cream or dairy hiding inside it. Instead, it’s a wholesome, flavorful blend of white beans, cashews, almond milk, and white miso paste. It’s not at all traditional, but you’ll be heading back for a second bowl before you know it.</p>

        <li>1 bunch of thyme, bundled</li>
        <li>1¼ cups cooked cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more for serving</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked wild rice</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 cups chopped kale</li>
        <li>Chopped parsley for garnish, optional</li>
        <li>Pinches of red pepper flakes, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the creamy base: Place the almond milk, cashews, white beans, miso paste, and Dijon mustard in a blender and process until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the soup: Heat the olive oil in a medium-large Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Add the scallions, celery, carrot, mushrooms, and salt and stir. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are tender, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, rosemary, thyme, cannellini beans, pepper, and water and stir. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the thyme bundle and stir in the cashew mixture, rice, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and kale. Simmer over low heat until the kale is wilted, about 5 minutes. Season to taste and serve with more lemon juice, parsley and pinches of red pepper flakes, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
